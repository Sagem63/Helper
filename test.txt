Recently, neutrosophic sets are found to be more general and useful to express
incomplete, indeterminate and inconsistent information. The purpose of this paper is to introduce
new aggregation operators based on logarithmic operations and to develop a multi-criteria
decision-making approach to study the interaction between the input argument under the single
valued neutrosophic (SVN) environment. The main advantage of the proposed operator is that it can
deal with the situations of the positive interaction, negative interaction or non-interaction among the
criteria, during decision-making process. In this paper, we also defined some logarithmic operational
rules on SVN sets, then we propose the single valued neutrosophic hybrid aggregation operators as a
tool for multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) under the neutrosophic environment and discussd
some properties. Finally, the detailed decision-making steps for the single valued neutrosophic
MCDM problems were developed, and a practical case was given to check the created approach and
to illustrate its validity and superiority. Besides this, a systematic comparison analysis with other
existent methods is conducted to reveal the advantages of our proposed method. Results indicate that
the proposed method is suitable and effective for decision process to evaluate their best alternative.
